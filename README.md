The user profile is created using React and deployed using gh-pages.

The master branch contains the react app used in development.

The gh-pages branch contains the built files and is used to host the user profile.

### Note

Since this is being deployed in a Github user page instead of a project page, any path is considered a homepage path for projects and if they do not exist Github displays their 404 page. Therefore, the PageNotFound page is not complete since it is not being used.
